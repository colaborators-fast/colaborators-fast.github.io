I promise you to give my 100 percent and make the coming 3 days the best of your life.
             Please do not hesitate to contact me anytime.   <br>

           <p>
             It is my privilege to welcome you to the first edition of National Youth Model United Nations 2018.
             We all have been witnessing how MUNs are degrading their purpose-knowledge, debating, negotiating and cooperating. Today we see a loss of the vision with which MUNs were devised as a concept. <br>
             We, at NYMUN are focused at doing our bit to bring back the focus of MUNs on diplomacy, debate and the most importantly doing what a model is supposed to- simulate in the closest manner.
             I, Maaz bin Aijaz, being a director general of NYMUN assure this an enjoyable experience for you all as it is for all of us as the administration members of this conference.
             Here, we provide you the ultimate opportunity to improve your skills and experience something that you've never experienced before.
             Thank you so much for your time and hope to see you there. <br>

             Hello Delegates this your Director General Internal Affairs. You’ll probably recognise me as the loudest person in the room but oh well what’s a will to speak without some voice. To voice your facebook posts and comments step out into the real world. It’s an oppurtunity, to learn, convey and confess your love anonymously to that person sitting quietly at the other end of the room. 🤷🏻‍♀ Search up your facts, tone up your voice and bring yourself into the field. Serving you with the best InShaaAllah,<br>

                  Asalamualaikum! My name is Hajra Shah, and I am the Director of Marketing. Currently doing my O levels from Beaconhouse, I have always been invested in debates and politics, and a platform where both come together highly piqued my interest, and that is how my MUNing career started, from BM MUN I where I was awarded an OD. Since then, I have attended plenty of MUNs and won several awards. I have also managed and chaired and was the Secretary-General of BSMUN 2018. Other than that, I have participated in parliamentary style debates and speech competitions
                NYMUN promises to be one of the best events in Multan, and with an amazingly high level of debate, it is not something to be missed! Hope to see everyone there.
